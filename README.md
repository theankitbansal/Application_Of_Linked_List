Detailed application of linked list


Introduction
In the field of software development, when it comes to managing data, multiple tools could accomplish the job. The idea is to understand which tool is the suitable one to utilize for our given purpose. As a reminder, despite which language we begin coding, one of the first things that we come across are data structures, which, by now we should be acquainted with.

The objects that make use of various ways to shape and structure the data are termed Data Structures. Usually, they are made up of primitives such as hashes, objects, variables, or arrays. Nevertheless, these are just the start when it comes to the potential. There are numerous others that may start to sound complex as you understand more about their properties. A linked list is one of the data structures that may sound complex at first but the more you learn about linked lists, the more interesting they can get. Linked lists are very easy to comprehend, but they tend to have this reputation of being complicated. The more you know about them, the more you understand that it is not the structure of linked lists that will baffle you. Instead, it takes some time to fully understand the logic to decide when and how to use them.
